My research revolves around the study of out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Specifically, my main goal is to identify the general principles governing the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. I chose to work in this field because I believe it poses some of the most interesting questions of modern theoretical physics: it explores new emergent dynamical phenomena as well as long-standing gaps in our fundamental understanding of Nature. This quest also led me to consider aspects of quantum integrability and many-body quantum chaos.

My research is mainly analytical and combines ideas from statistical mechanics, quantum information, quantum integrability, and random matrix theory.
