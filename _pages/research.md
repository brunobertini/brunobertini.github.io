My research revolves around the study of out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. This quest also led me to consider aspects of many-body quantum chaos and quantum integrability.
  
For most of its life many-body quantum mechanics has been concerned with the study of equilibrium phenomena because of experimental restrictions. With the turn of the millennium the situation has begun to change: non-equilibrium quantum matter is now routinely accessible in experiments and understanding it represents one of the frontiers of theoretical physics.   

The main obstacle to tackle is the lack of general techniques to study many-body systems out of equilibrium. My strategy to forge them is to find minimal models where the whole many-body dynamics can be characterised exactly and use them to build a general understanding.

[comment]: # (My contributions followed two main strands. The first revolves around the study of (nearly) integrable many-body quantum systems, while the second is focussed on the dynamics of quantum chaotic ones. Integrable systems are a special class of interacting many-body quantum systems characterised by an extensive number of conservation laws that are able to constrain the scattering making it purely elastic and factorised. These conservation laws are “local” (i.e. have a local density) and result from a hidden algebraic structure (or symmetry) — based on the celebrated Yang-Bater equation — which enables exact calculations even in the presence of interactions. Chaotic systems on the other hand have no local conservation law. These systems are not generically solvable and my strategy has been is to find special examples characterised by new algebraic structures — alternative to Yang-Baxter — allowing for exact solutions.)


[comment]: # (In the context of integrability my key result has been the co-development of a hydrodynamic theory, now known as “generalized hydrodynamics” (GHD), describing the asymptotic dynamics in systems with macroscopically many local conservation laws [23] (see also Refs. [24,25,66]). Essentially, this theory allows to rewrite the macroscopic number of continuity equations (one for each conservation law) as an exact (non-collisional) Boltzmann equation for the distribution function of some stable quasi particles (the existence of which is a characteristic property of such systems). GHD has led to a vast number of theoretical developments in integrability, fluid theory, and statistical mechanics (see the JSTAT special issue Emergent Hydrodynamics in in Integrable Many-Body Systems for a comprehensive account) and, at the same time, has found direct experimental application (two independent experiments [33,34] have recently showed that GHD provides the most accurate quantitative description of real cold-atom gases). Together with GHD I also gave two additional important contributions: (i) I co-developed a framework to describe the large time dynamics of a class of order-parameter-like observables in the presence of interactions [13]; (ii) I observed and characterised an integrable-to-non-integrable crossover similar to that described by the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory in few-particle classical systems [19]. This phenomenon, termed “prethermalization”, is of crucial practical importance: it shows that integrability can be experimentally observed. Key Results on Quantum Chaotic Many-Body Systems.) 


[comment]: # (Concerning quantum chaos my key main contribution has been to identify a class of quantum chaotic systems, termed dual-unitary quantum circuits [39], where spectral correlations [40,37] and full many-body dynamics [41,42] can be accessed rigorously. In essence, these systems can be thought of as special “quantum circuits”, i.e, many-body systems in discrete space where the time-evolution is defined in discrete time-steps involving only products of commuting unitary operators (or “gates”) and connecting two neighbouring sites. These models capture what can be considered the primary and most essential feature of extended systems — the locality of the interactions — by imposing a strict light cone for the propagation of information. The special property of dual unitary circuits is that their gates remain unitary under a particular index reshuffling: this ensures that their dynamics remain unitary also when the roles of time and space are swapped. As shown in [39], this property directly implies that these systems have completely accessible dynamical (spatio-temporal) correlations. Moreover, as shown in [47,48,49,50], generic dual-unitary circuits scramble quantum information at the maximal speed allowed by the local structure of the interactions.)
